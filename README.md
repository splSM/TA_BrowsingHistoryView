# BrowsingHistoryView Add-on for Splunk©
### by Aaron Chandler

## Featuring: **BrowsingHistoryView v2.46** © Nir Sofer www.nirsoft.net/utils/browsing_history_view.html

This add-on is intended for deployment to Windows clients (my thought was workstations, but I suppose Windows servers with a web browser in use could be a data source, too).

A little .bat script will run every hour and obtain the client's internet browsing history in an XML file, which Splunk will then parse using the provided sourcetype.

Please visit [the BrowsingHistoryView website](www.nirsoft.net/utils/browsing_history_view.html) to see other command-line options which you could use to tailor this add-on for your specific needs.

### Installation:

1. Place this add-on in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps on your Deployment Server.
2. Create a $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps/BrowsingHistoryView/local directory.
3. Copy the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps/BrowsingHistoryView/default/inputs.conf file to your newly-made $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/deployment-apps/BrowsingHistoryView/local.
4. Modify your newly-pasted inputs.conf file to change any configurations which you'd like to alter; e.g. change the disabled parameters to 1 for the inputs to run.
5. Deploy the add-on to your Windows clients.
6. Place the out-of-box add-on (**without** the modified inputs.conf) in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps directory on your search head(s) so you can use the provided sourcetype in your searches.
7. If you're running a full-blown Splunk node on Windows (shudder), you can also place the add-on (**with** the modified inputs.conf) in that node's $SPLUNK_HOME\etc\apps directory.
